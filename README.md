# ScreenshotMagnifier
Magnifies a selected part of the screen.

Intention was to get the status bar of Age Of Empires onto a secondary screen for visually impaired people to see what the status currently is.

On the first tab a section of the screen can be selected.
That part is then shown enlarged on the second tab.

The screenshot is refreshed every 300ms

The program stores the current settings and loads them on start.
